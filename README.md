## Overview

This is my attempt at solving Frontend Mentor's Product Preview Card Component challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

I started with the mobile layout first and tried to get as close as I could to the design. Once I was content with the look of the mobile layout I set the media rules for displaying the desktop layout. This was tricky for me at first but I eventually figured out a simple solution using Flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned how to make use of media rules and Flexbox to create a responsive webpage.

### Continued development

I have much to learn about responsive web design and will continue to learn more techniques with practice and research.
